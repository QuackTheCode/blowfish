# About

As the digital world expands, so do the threats that come with it. Every new app, website, and IoT device offers convenience, but with it, new vulnerabilities we often overlook. Have you ever stopped to think about the security of your online accounts? The data you share? Even the simplest actions online could open doors to malicious actors. This is the growing danger of an interconnected world. With the rising complexity of digital threats, the need for skilled cybersecurity professionals has never been greater. If we donâ€™t fill this gap, the risks to our personal privacy, businesses, and society as a whole could become catastrophic.
